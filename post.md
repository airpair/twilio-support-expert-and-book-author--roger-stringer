Roger Stringer has been working with _Twilio's API since day one_. When he's not working with clients, building a new startup or traveling around to conferences to speak about Twilio and APIs, he is writing books about Twilio such as the _[Twilio Cookbook](http://airpair-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/twilio-cookbook.jpg)_, the upcoming _Twilio Reference Guide_, and _Mastering Twilio_.

## Roger's Career, In His Own Words

I've been in the software development field since 1998, and I've built hundreds of software projects for clients over the years. I work primarily with PHP, but I also work with Python, Ruby and Node.js. When I am not working on the web, I enjoy reading, cooking, and spending time with my daughter Kaitlyn at local farmers' markets. 

## Becoming a Twilio Expert

When Twilio launched, I saw something interesting and immediately joined their site. Since then, I've built projects such as TheInterviewr.com, a Twilio-powered startup that makes interviewing more efficient by helping with scheduling, contact management, and conducting and recording interviews. I also worked on various other apps using Twilio's API, ranging from Live blogging, photo walls, call centers, IVR systems, conference call systems, and several other topics.

## Writing About Twilio's API

Last year, I wrote the _[Twilio Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/twilio-cookbook/book)_, which is a book teaching people how to use Twilio. This year I followed up with another book called _Twilio Reference Guide_, and I am currently in the process of writing _Mastering Twilio_.

They say that you don't really understand a subject until you teach it to someone. I certainly found that writing these three books has not only helped me establish credibility as a Twilio expert, but it also expanded my own skills and understanding of Twilio's API and its use cases.

## Working With AirPair

I see AirPair in the same vein as writing books - I not only get a chance to help people, but it also pushes me to stay sharp in some of the technical areas that I really care about and want to stay involved in. Other than Twilio, those areas include WordPress, MySQL, NoSQL and REST APIs.
